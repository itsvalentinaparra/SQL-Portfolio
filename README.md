Project that takes in consideration sales data of three cities in Myanmar (Birmania). With the creation of a data base to import variables as client type, quantity bought, revenue, and so on, the data was altered and used to answer questions as: "What is the type of customer that brings the most revenue", "Number of sales made in each time of the day per weekday", and so on.
